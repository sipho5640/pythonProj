#a tuple is a form of a data structure where we can store different values/multiple pieces of information
coordinates = (4, 5), (6, 7), (8,9)  #a tuple cannot be changed or modified once created
#coordinates[1] = 10 #tuples are immutable
print(coordinates[0])
#a list uses square parentheses
#you store data in a tuple where you have no intentions of changing it
